* The autopsy photo in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9exzWqnuPmg is not of Epstein.
* Beware of everyone claiming that Jeffrey Epstein is not dead; they may be
  covering up his murder knowingly. Are they masons?

These images and files prove that Epstein was likely physically assulted (broken ear cartilege and broken nose) long before he was murdered in his cell.
