* Jeffrey Epstein was murdered.
* His initial photo in the stretcher was likely mirror refersed to create confusion.
* The reason why his ear looked different was due to a shadow.
* His nose was broken prior to or on the day of his death.
* The autopsy photo in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9exzWqnuPmg is not of Epstein.
* Beware of everyone claiming that Jeffrey Epstein is not dead; they may be
  covering up his murder knowingly. Are they masons?
