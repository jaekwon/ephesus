What are the biblical locusts in Revelation 9?

> Berean Standard Bible (Revelation 9 "The Fifth Trumpet"): 
> 1: Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen
>    from heaven to earth, and it was given the key to the pit of the Abyss.
> 2: The star opened the pit of the Abyss, and smoke rose out of it like the
>    smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the
>    smoke from the pit.
> 3: And out of the smoke, **locusts** descended on the earth, and they were given
>    power like that of the scorpions of the earth.
> 4: They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree,
>    but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
> 5: The **locusts** were not given power to kill them, but only to torment them
>    for five months, and their torment was like the stinging of a scorpion.
> 6: In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to
>    die, but death will escape them.
> 7: And the **locusts** looked like horses prepared for battle, with something
>    like crowns of gold on their heads; **and their faces were like the faces of
>    men**.
> 8: They had hair like that of women, and teeth like those of lions.
> 9: They also had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of
>    their wings was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into
>    battle.
> 10: They had tails with stingers like scorpions, which had the power to
>    injure people for five months.
> 11: They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His name in Hebrew
     is Abaddon,a and in Greek it is Apollyon.

Why were the locusts' faces like the faces of men? Joel 1 answers:

> Berean Standard Bible	(Joel 1 "The Invasion of Locusts"):
> 1: This is the word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
> 2: Hear this, O elders;
>      and give ear, all who dwell in the land.
>    Has anything like this ever happened in your days
>      or in the days of your fathers?
> 3: Tell it to your children;
>      let your children tell it to their children,
>      and their children to the next generation.
> 4: What the devouring **locust** has left,
>      the swarming **locust** has eaten;
>    what the swarming **locust** has left,
>      the young **locust** has eaten;
>    and what the young **locust** has left,
>      the destroying **locust** has eaten.
> 5: Wake up, you drunkards, and weep;
>      wail, all you drinkers of wine,
>    because of the sweet wine,
>      for it has been cut off from your mouth.
> 6: For **a nation** has invaded My land,
>      powerful and without number;
>    its teeth are the teeth of a lion,
>      and its fangs are the fangs of a lioness.
> 7: It has laid waste My grapevine
>      and splintered My fig tree.
>    It has stripped off the bark and thrown it away;
>      the branches have turned white.

In Joel 1:6, "a nation" is originally "goyim"; foreigners.
