> Another thing i wanted zo ask you...whats your take on the concept of free will?

You can be deterministic, or with god, or be possessed, or think you are god;
or change; and what state you're in today is not always the state you're in
tomorrow, and the end state is one where you give your will to god, and the
question doesn't matter.

It's a privilege to see. I'm here for the ride.

The wind blows with your thoughts when you align your will with god's.  Being
is more wonderful/holy/beautiful that way.

Free will is the expression of what lightning rod you want to become.  And the
universe bends for you if you keep the narrow path.

I've never thougth that I was God. so I can't really speak for it.

But I can imagine the recursive case.
And it makes the analysis complicated.

In the end there are decisions beyond scripture and here's where God grants
free will to watch of us.

The fruit of the tree of life is (a book) of the time of such.

The lamb exercises free will by definition as it opens the book of life.

> I myself imagine free will as a tool so the creation can manifest itself

So alignment makes for magical synchronicities.

It is complicated by those who understand this already and work against the
written one.

> Who are those?

Satanists.

Funded by the Rothschilds. Sits on the whore
The whore of babylon is still human.
Satan is man that is not.
