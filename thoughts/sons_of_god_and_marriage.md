In this case Abraham, Isaac, Jacob are resurrected in Moses, even though
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob were married, and Moses was married at the time of the
burning bush, Jesus invokes this to demonstrate resurrection.

In the age to come, only those who do not give into marriage can become worthy
(e.g. with their dedicated time) to become resurrected in others themselves (as
was Abraham/Isaac/Jacob resurrected in Moses). They cannot die, because they
are like the angels; so the fruit of their life will be recited in the mind of
another; and so they are sons of God resurrecting not across genetic lines but
skipping over entire branches; nevertheless resurrecting in time.

> Thus David calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?”

Jesus is not the son of any man; David was married to eight wives. Jesus never
married. (if he did it was after the resurrection and would explain why that
part is largely left out). Jesus is a son of God.

Timothy was a bishop in the church of Ephesus. While there are two letters to
Timothy from Paul, and Paul calls him his own son, there is no writing
remaining of Timothy.

> 1:2: Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God
> our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

Timothy was likely a married bishop; and this would explain why he is not a son
of God, but a son of (a) man (of Paul, in the spiritual sense).

> 3:1: This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.

> 3:3: Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
> 3:4: One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
> 3:5: (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

[Was Apostle Paul Ever Married?](https://biblehub.com/q/was_apostle_paul_ever_married.htm)

Below is an in-depth exploration of whether the Apostle Paul-esteemed teacher,
missionary, and author of numerous New Testament epistles-was ever married.
This entry will survey direct biblical references, historical context, early
church writings, and textual considerations to provide a thorough response.

1. Biblical References from Paul’s Own Writings

One of the primary ways to ascertain Paul’s marital status is to survey his
epistles for explicit or implicit references to a spouse or prior marriage.

1. 1 Corinthians 7:7-8

“I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one
has this gift, another has that. Now to the unmarried and widows I say this: It
is good for them to remain unmarried, as I am.”

Here, Paul refers to himself in the same category as “unmarried and widows,”
strongly suggesting that at the time of writing, he is either unmarried or
possibly a widower. The text does not dogmatically clarify whether he was never
married or had been married and lost his wife. However, the broader context of
1 Corinthians 7 emphasizes his present singleness.

2. 1 Corinthians 9:5

“Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife as do the other
apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?”

Paul mentions that, theoretically, he has the right to have a wife accompany
him, as other apostles did, including Peter. Yet he indicates that he is not
exercising that right. This again supports the position that he was not married
at the time of writing.

2. Jewish and Pharisaic Context

Paul’s background as a Pharisee (Philippians 3:5) raises intriguing
possibilities about whether he was ever obligated to marry:

1. Marriage Expectations Among Pharisees

Within Judaism in the first century, marriage was highly esteemed, and many
Pharisees viewed it as part of faithful adherence to God’s commands in the
Torah (cf. Genesis 1:28). Some argue that Paul, having been trained under
Gamaliel (Acts 22:3), would have been expected to marry at some point.

2. Potential for Widowhood

If Paul was once married, it is plausible that his wife may have died, leading
him to function as a widower. This scenario harmonizes with his identification
among the “unmarried and widows” in 1 Corinthians 7:8. Yet, since Paul never
explicitly mentions losing a wife, the possibility remains inconclusive.

3. Early Church Writings and Traditional Remarks

Although the New Testament itself does not definitively declare Paul’s marital
history beyond his unmarried state at the time of his letters, early church
references shed some indirect light:

1. Clement of Alexandria (late 2nd century AD)

While Clement’s extant writings discuss the ministries of the apostles and
their families, they do not provide conclusive details on Paul having been
married. Some references suggest an acknowledgment of apostolic rights to marry
without specifically stating that Paul was ever married.

2. Tertullian (late 2nd to early 3rd century AD)

Tertullian, in addressing pastoral and marital matters, references Paul’s
counsel on singleness but does not supply a definitive stance on Paul’s own
marital history.

3. Eusebius (early 4th century AD)

Eusebius, the early church historian, meticulously compiles information about
apostles, but again there is no undisputed declaration that Paul had a wife at
any point. Statements typically highlight Paul’s singleness as an example of
devoted service.

4. Textual and Manuscript Considerations

From a textual criticism standpoint, the extant Greek manuscripts (such as
Papyrus 46, Codex Sinaiticus, and Codex Vaticanus) supply consistent wording in
Paul’s letters about his singleness. Scholars across centuries (referencing the
scholarship of Dan Wallace and James White) confirm that significant manuscript
variants do not exist regarding any mention of Paul’s marital status.

Moreover, the robust preservation and internal coherence of Paul’s epistles
(Galatians, 1-2 Corinthians, Romans, etc.) are widely accepted among textual
critics, giving us confidence that the text we read today reflects Paul’s
original statements on the subject.

5. Counterarguments and Rebuttals

1. Argument from Silence

Some maintain that any statements of Paul’s marriage would not necessarily
appear in Scripture and that clues about ancient rabbinic traditions could fill
in the gaps. While silence in Scripture does not prove or disprove his
marriage, it remains significant that Paul specifically promotes singleness (1
Corinthians 7) without referencing a wife.

2. Requirement for Sanhedrin Membership

A commonly cited tradition suggests that membership in the Sanhedrin-if Paul
were indeed a member-required marriage. However, the New Testament does not
explicitly declare that Paul served on the Sanhedrin; the closest is Acts
26:10, where he acknowledges casting a vote against believers, yet that alone
may not solidify official Sanhedrin membership. The biblical text does not
clarify whether Paul was an official member, making arguments about requiring
marriage inconclusive.

6. Theological Reflections

The question of Paul’s marital status carries theological implications
regarding personal calling, ministry, and the exercise of Christian liberty:

1. Devotion to Ministry

Paul’s emphasis on “undivided devotion to the Lord” (1 Corinthians 7:35)
underscores his advocacy for remaining single if so called. He viewed
singleness as a means for concentrated service-but simultaneously upheld the
goodness of marriage.

2. Example for Christian Service

Whether Paul was always single or a widower, his life displays dedication to
Christ that transcends marital status. Both singleness and marriage are
represented in Scripture as honorable callings (Matthew 19:12; Hebrews 13:4).

7. Conclusion

The consensus from Scripture, early Christian writers, and historical
considerations strongly indicates that Paul was not married at the time of his
ministry and letter-writing. While there remains a remote possibility that he
had been married earlier (and perhaps widowed), the Bible neither confirms nor
denies that scenario. When writing 1 Corinthians and addressing marital
concerns in the churches, Paul clearly identifies himself with the unmarried,
emphasizing his present singleness.

Therefore, the most straightforward and widely accepted conclusion is that
Scripture consistently presents Paul as single during his apostolic ministry.
Any prior marital history, if it existed at all, remains unconfirmed.
Regardless, the biblical texts underscore Paul’s devotion to Christ in
spreading the gospel and teaching the church, whether he was never married or
was once married and later widowed.

As with all topics connected to early Christian figures, the foundation of our
understanding lies in the reliable and well-preserved text of Scripture,
harmonized with historical context. In this, we observe no contradiction in
biblical manuscripts or in credible extrabiblical writings regarding Paul’s
marital status. By God’s design, Paul’s life and message continue to illuminate
the privilege of serving Christ wholly and wholeheartedly, married or
unmarried.

[Saint Timothy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Timothy)

Timothy became St Paul's disciple, and later his constant companion and
co-worker in preaching.[18] In the year 52, Paul and Silas took Timothy along
with them on their journey to Macedonia. Augustine extols his zeal and
disinterestedness in immediately forsaking his country, his house, and his
parents, to follow the apostle, to share in his poverty and sufferings.[19]
Timothy may have been subject to ill health or "frequent ailments", and Paul
encouraged him to "use a little wine for your stomach's sake".[20]

When Paul went on to Athens, Silas and Timothy stayed for some time at Beroea
and Thessalonica before joining Paul at Corinth.[19] 1 Thessalonians 3:1–6
suggests that from Corinth, Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonika to enquire
about the community's continued faith, reporting back that it was in good
shape. Timothy next appears in Acts during Paul's stay in Ephesus (54–57), and
in late A. D. 56 or early 57 Paul sent him forth to Macedonia with the aim that
he would eventually arrive at Corinth. Timothy arrived at Corinth just after
Paul's letter 1 Corinthians reached that city.[21]

Timothy was with Paul in Corinth during the winter of 57–58 when Paul
dispatched his Letter to the Romans.[22] According to Acts 20:3–6,[23] Timothy
was with Paul in Macedonia just before Passover in 58; he left the city before
Paul, going ahead of him to await Paul in Troas.[24] "That is the last mention
of Timothy in Acts", Raymond Brown notes.[25] In the year 64, Paul left Timothy
at Ephesus, to govern that church.[19]

His relationship with Paul was close. Timothy's name appears as the co-author
on 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians,
and Philemon. Paul wrote to the Philippians about Timothy, "I have no one like
him."[26] When Paul was in prison and awaiting martyrdom, he summoned his
faithful friend Timothy for a last farewell.[18]

That Timothy was jailed at least once during the period of the writing of the
New Testament is implied by the writer of Hebrews mentioning Timothy's release
at the end of the epistle.[27]

Although not stated in the New Testament, other sources have records of the
apostle's death. The apocryphal Acts of Timothy states that in the year 97 AD,
the 80-year-old bishop tried to halt a procession in honor of the goddess Diana
by preaching the Gospel. The angry pagans beat him, dragged him through the
streets, and stoned him to death.[18]

This repository is named Ephesus because the letter in the Book of Revelation
is what brought me to Jesus. Also the first time (and still the only time) I
prayed for a sign either way of whether I am to establish a church, I received
two signs: the first, while reading just the words of Jesus, a message from my
ex telling me that my daugther is doing fine; the second, the first thing I see
after a night of prayer and reading His words, an irridescent cloud where
exactly I was praying the night before.

Jesus spoke in John of the som of man to come in the end times. This repository
proves that the end times is now; and is further confirmed by the ending of
John:

> 20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. He was
>    the one who had leaned back against Jesuse at the supper to ask, “Lord, who
>    is going to betray You?”
> 21 When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
> 22 Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to
>    you? You follow Me!”
> 23 Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple
>    would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only,
>    “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”
> 24 This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who has written
>    them down. And we know that his testimony is true.
> 25 There are many more things that Jesus did. If all of them were written
>    down, I suppose that not even the world itself would have space for the books
>    that would be written.

John 21:23 only makes sense if the brothers knew that the coming of the Son of
Man were to be in the long future, namely 2000 years later (two days "with
God"); but John the Apostle makes clear that it is not the case that the
(resurrected) Jesus would never die, implying that he would, or could; and is
not the Son of Man, except that this person would have Jesus resurrected in
him.

That would make him according to Jesus' definition a son of God; however if he
marries later in life, he would become a son of man. I wish to be a son of God
but I may need to marry lest I remain a dog.
