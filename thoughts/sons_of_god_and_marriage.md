In this case Abraham, Isaac, Jacob are resurrected in Moses, even though
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob were married, and Moses was married at the time of the
burning bush, Jesus invokes this to demonstrate resurrection.

In the age to come, only those who do not give into marriage can become worthy
(e.g. with their dedicated time) to become resurrected in others themselves (as
was Abraham/Isaac/Jacob resurrected in Moses). They cannot die, because they
are like the angels; so the fruit of their life will be recited in the mind of
another; and so they are sons of God resurrecting not across genetic lines but
skipping over entire branches; nevertheless resurrecting in time.

Jesus is not the son of any man; David was married to eight wives. Jesus never
married. (if he did it was after the resurrection and would explain why that
part is largely left out). Jesus is a son of God.

So I won't marry.
