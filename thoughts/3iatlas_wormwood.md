# 3I/Atlas and Wormwood

**A hypothetical debris field trailing 3I/Atlas (and ejecta from its anti-tail
around 8/25/25) may collide with Earth around 3/10/26 to darken the skies and
produce Cyanide, fulfilling the prophecy of Wormwood (see appendix).**

There is much speculation about 3I/Atlas but there isn't enough certainty about
what it is. That much is certain.

First I will propose a new hypothetical model that explains 3I/Atlas.

 1. V4200 is a Cyanide rich nearby star where the unidentified "WOW signal" originated.
 2. Carbonatious ejecta from V4200 get pushed outward by its solar wind.
 3. The disperse carbonatious material clumps together by gravitational forces.
 4. 3I/Atlas is a clump of clumps of carbonatious material.
 5. Before it arrives near our sun Sol the smaller clumps are pushed back.
 6. 3I/Atlas is trailed by a field of carbonatious debris hidden by its dust tail.
 7. 3I/Atlas is a periodic phenomena described as Wormwood that planted life on Earth.

 See [image](./images/3i_atlas_debris_field.png).

You can use a tool to visualize the trajectory of 3I/Atlas versus the sun and
planets. See https://www.atlascomet.com/3d-interstellar-tracker.

Most concerning is the hypothetical debris, but also any material ejected from
3I/Atlas's anti-tail headed toward the Sun and Jupiter from around 8/25/25 and
the many months before would have been slowed down (repelled) by solar wind and
pulled by Mars to collide with the Earth around 3/10/26 as well.

Professor Avi Loeb claims that 3I/Atlas is too far away for any of the larger
particles of 3I/Atlas' anti-tail to reach Earth in any meaningful capacity,
but it does not seem that Avi Loeb or anyone has considered the anti-tail 
ejecta from 8/25/25 and long before being slowed/repelled by the Sun as
well as pulled toward the Earth by Mars for a slingshot collision on Earth
around 3/10/26.

Furthermore noone observing 3I/Atlas is thinking about a trailing debris field;
people are still trying to figure out what it is, without considering the seven
points above. At this time any attempt of observation of a hypothetical debris
field may fail because of the accumulated dust trail as seen from Clipper (see
image https://imgur.com/a/is-3i-atlas-wormwood-84Iqs0M#JFyrPbC). The European
Space Agency's Solar Orbiter which operates in solar polar orbit could be used
to detect any debris field from above.

The one circumstantial evidence we have for a debris field is the recent
malfunctioning of the Mars orbital satellite Maven.

Such a hypotheticl debris field trailing 3I/Atlas (or any field ejected from
its anti-tail or tail) would not be interceptable by any man-made defense
weapon. First there would be a hail of fireballs that may crash unto the Earth
and begin the darken portions of the sky. Later, larger pieces would crash into
the seas and oceans and create tsunami waves. Then, any following debris that
lands under the darkened sky would do the same and in addition create Cyanide
that is otherwise not prevented by photodissociation. Finally, the day and
night sky would be darkened for a period of months. 

This is what is described in Revelation 8:7-12.

> Berean Standard Bible:
> Revelation 8:7: Then the first angel sounded his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, along with a third of the trees and all the green grass.
> Revelation 8:8: Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood,
> Revelation 8:9: a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
> Revelation 8:10: Then the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
> Revelation 8:11: The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil, and many people died from the bitter waters.
> Revelation 8:12: Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck. A third of the stars were darkened, a third of the day was without light, and a third of the night as well.

NOTE: youtuber @DobsonianPower [asked this question independently
too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R0YWlu99nY) but he takes Professor Avi
Loeb's word for it that it won't impact the Earth in significant quantities.

> NASA Flags 3I/Atlas for Losing 5B Tons Per Month—Interstellar Comet Defies
> Natural Laws.

Avi Loeb hypothesizes that 3I/Atlas is recently losing **5 billion tons per
month** in order to account for its change in trajectory, assuming standard
cometary dynamics. Even a tiny fraction of 5 billion tons is sufficient to
fulfill the Wormwood prophecy.

It is a bit concerning that we aren't sure whether such debris and gas has been
emitted in the anti-tail, or whether it is due to sun-directed jets stronger
than typical comets, but what is surely needed is better understanding of the
components ejected by the anti-tail and any trailing debris by infrared and
X-ray imagine also from the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter.

> 3I/Atlas is estimated to have a mass of over 33 billion tons, with some
> calculations suggesting it may have lost around 16% of its mass through
> outgassing.

This is reminiscent of the "eye of the pyramid" where the eye sits above 33
stones; the same symbol in back of the US dollar bill; like the hypothetical
debris field trailing 3I/Atlas.
