Regarding the prophecy of Isiah:

> 7: He was oppressed and afflicted,
>      yet He did not open His mouth.
>    He was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
>      and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,
>    so **He did not open His mouth**.

This seems to go against the claim that Jesus protested taxes.
But consider the earlier portion that complements the above:

> 15: so He will sprinkleg many nations.
>       **Kings will shut their mouths** because of Him.
>     For **they will see what they have not been told**,
>       and **they will understand what they have not heard**.

What is it that Jesus did not open his mouth to speak that the kings will shut
their mouths when they understand what they have not ever heard?

Recall that the Sanhedrin chief priests also shut their mouths because they
understood what was not said.

> 25: So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is
>     God’s.”
> 26: And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people. And
>     amazed at His answer, they fell silent.

Jesus fulfilled Isiah with a protest that didn't sound like a protest.

You can't deny what Jesus said (to Peter) regarding the temple tax, that he
shouldn't have to pay; and that he told Peter to pay for both of them half of
what they should, so as to not offend them. It's right there--Jesus protested
the temple tax to Peter, whether or not he paid half or full.

Furthermore Sanhedrin *wanted* to arrest him but couldn't until he said what he
said, "Render unto caesar...". The New Testament, the Talmud, all say that he
was "inciting"; in the New Testament, specifically for taxes. In the Sanhedrin
Talmud, it only says "incite", and in modern translations annotated with
additional verbiage that does not fit (to obscure the fact that he protested
taxes).

Jesus didn't say outright "don't pay taxes". Jesus said something half way. He
himself didn't have any denarius, so he had to ask someone else for it. And he
wasn't a common laborer. So he sort of trolled the scribes and priests of
Sanhedrin.

If Jesus's intent was for us to pay the full taxes due to authorities, he would
have said "pay your taxes", but he didn't. Why would the son of God say
anything but the truth in this case clearly: he has no reason to fear
Sanhedrin, he already knew that he would be crucified. So why did he say what
he did in that particular way?

He could have said "don't pay your taxes" but of course he'd get arrested
outright there, and also it would go against the prophecy of Isaiah. He didn't
want to offend anyone even as he protested, as evidenced w/ his convo with
Peter. In case you haven't read the [whole document](https://ephesus.church),
you should.

If what he said wasn't a protest (protestant?), Sanhedrin wouldn't have gone
off complaining to the Romans claiming that he was inciting a tax revolt. Why
would Sanhedrin wait until after Jesus said "Render unto Caesar..." when they
had already wanted to arrest Jesus? You could say that it's because what Jesus
said was distorted by Sanhedrin. But then you're saying that Jesus said the
wrong thing; yet the New Testament makes clear that Jesus said the perfect
thing.

The definition of protest is to make a public display of your opinion about
something. And anything short of "pay your taxes" is a protest; and what Jesus
said to Peter was most definitely a protest.

Jesus said the perfect thing, which is why they (Sanhedrin) marveled for a
while, and then complained later to the Romans away from the people. If Jesus
had said "don't pay your taxes" it would have been the wrong thing. It goes
against the [messianic grand week plan](https://github.com/jaekwon/ephesus),
which Sanhedrin also surely knows of. As you can also tell by the blowing of
the shofar this year 2025 in Israel, broadcast worldwide for the first time.

The time to recognize that Jesus was a tax protester wasn't 2000 years ago or
1000 years ago. It's supposed to happen now.

Paul knew that Jesus sealed the deal with his statement, "Render unto Caesar
what is Caesar's". The proof is in the pudding, it came first, and everyone
knows this part.

Sanhedrin in the talmud literally records Jesus's incitement. Of what?
The New Testament in Luke clearly says that it is about taxes.

> Berean Literal bible (Luke 23):
> 2: And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our
>    nation, **forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar**, and proclaiming Himself to

It is literally in both the New Testament and the Talmud (Sanhedrin). Though as
mentioned in the [Gnoland Manifesto Whitepaper](https://ephesus.church) Sefaria
adds extra language that it was for idol worship, which makes no sense.  Idol
worship is not incitement; nor did Jesus "incite" anyone for idol worship.

Sanhedrin in the talmud literally records Jesus's incitement. Of what?
As mentioned before, the New Testament says it is about taxes. It's literally
both in the New Testament and Talmud. Though sefaria.org adds extra language

Salvation is only through Jesus brother. <3

What I am an expert at is seeing proof of manipulation. I saw that the covid19
vaccine was harmful for young people and was railing against it before anyone
else was, there was even an article saying that I was the only person in crypto
doing so.

Paul is not a prophet.

amend Matthew's account of Jesus before Pilate about taxes?**

**Luke was making a point about taxes, clearly. What was Luke's point?**

**Why was Sanhedrin not able to trap Jesus with his words on the spot, and only
later go to Pilate to complain that he forbid paying taxes to Caesar? Was
Sanhedrin lying?**

> To make his persecution related to taxes

It is not the only reason, but it was the final straw. And this reason, as per
the prophecy of Isiah, was not spoke of, and nobody heard it. But it is meant
to be understood upon his return.

You're discounting Luke, a primary historian who had better access to
information than anyone. If Sanhedrin was lying, why did they wait until
*after* Jesus said "render unto Caesar"? Recall it says there that they already
wanted to arrest him. Why would they then finally go to the Romans to arrest
him after he said "pay your taxes"?

Sanhedrin at the time doesn't mention "mesit", idolatry. That's added as
commentary to "incite" in modern times. It says "incite", exactly what Luke said. 
The addition of "idolatry" in English in sanhedrin.org is a modern addition to
detract from the fact that he was accused of inciting regarding taxes; so that
we don't discover that Jesus was silently protesting taxes.

Idolatry, which Jesus never preached, is not even incitement. Even claiming to
be the king of the Jews, the messiah, is not incitement; the romans clearly
agreed. 

Though Sanhedrin is accused by Jesus of being liars, I would say that they did
have reason to fear Jesus inciting a tax revolt. My analysis is that this was
somewhat valid, is ultimately why Jesus got arrested by the reporting of
Sanhedrin; again fulfilling Isaiah.

**Why does it say "they could not trap him with his words before the people"?
They could have trapped his words not before the people, by implication.**

**Your response explains why the Romans didn't immediately execute him.** And
explains the genius of Jesus's response; and you cannot discount that it
fulfills Isaiah, as I wrote Luke literally knew of Isaiah as I did, clearly,
and that is why he wrote it that way.

**Why further would future translations distort the word to imply that he meant
to pay full taxes to the temple?  And say that a quart of wheat would be worth
a penny, and even in the response to "Render unto Caesar"? A penny is not a
denarius.** And many translations omit the denomination completely.

**What is it in Isaiah that Jesus did not say that everyone will know, that
nobody heard?** His return today must surely fulfill something of that
prophecy; yet we have heard everything under the sun. But nobody has heard my
arguments until today.

They wanted to arrest/kill him but they could not until Jesus said "render unto
Caesar". (why would that be?) Judas betrayed his location where he could be
arrested quietly. Luke literally says they accused him of protesting taxes.
Have you not read my document? It's literally in the NT. It's even confirmed by
Sanhedrin in the talmud.

I'm not saying that the entrapment was contingent on observers; it was
contingent on the observers *not* being there; because to argue (correctly)
that what Jesus was saying would be tax protesting would end up inciting the
observers themselves by Sanhedrin. Thus they marveled at his answer.

Your own answer combined with Jesus's own words, that he should not pay any
taxes to the Temple because he and Peter are children are God, are clear and
sufficient evidence that Jesus *was* protesting taxes. Protest: "to express a
strong objection to something". Whether or not he paid, he protested.

To say otherwise is to inject your own bias into Jesus; but this bias comes
from millenia of conditioning by authorities.

Again I refer you to the prophecy of Isaiah, at the appendix of ephesus.church,
my analysis, and compare against any other analysis; you will see that my
interpretation fits best.

I have shown you a sliver of a mountain of evidence in [my
writing](https://ephesus.church) that there is an industrial scale attempt to
cover up the truth; but especially also more evidence that counters yours. It
is now on you to do more research that counters your point to discover that
indeed your evidence is likely a mis-transcription for the purpose of
extracting money from the people.

To them Jesus appeared as a blasphemer; and until Jesus died on the cross he
was not yet provably who he said he was, unless you had eyes to see and ears to
hear, or saw his miracles. Sanhedrin did not seek to crucify Jesus because they
knew he was right--they genuinely believed that he was wrong. And anyone would
accuse a false messiah of being a blasphemer; especially when they are inciting
people (deniably) to not pay their taxes; as that isn't exactly specified in
any scripture (until Jesus). (That said I am not saying that Sanhedrin didn't
lie about other things, nor is it completely true that Jesus was inciting a tax
revolt, even as he clearly protested taxes esp the temple tax).

I'm just making a side point that Sanhedrin had legitimate fear of Jesus and
what he was doing. Knowing this I blame them a little less than I used to, and
I can see why Jesus would forgive them. They are not like Rothschilds today who
intentionally mislead people with the funding of mistranslations for their own
agenda; whether or not they are bound by God to act as Satan.

I advise you to open your mind, refer again to the bold text above, and
metanoia, because it is time.
