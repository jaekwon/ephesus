Abusive language will not be tolerated. The only exceptions will be as follows:

Calling somebody a serpent, viper, dog, maggot, are allowed if you believe the
context warrents it. Other animals and insects too. You can call me a bug all
you want.

Calling someone a bot outright is not allowed; you can say that you suspect
someone of being a bot. But saying that someone is a bot is akin to telling
them that they are stupid, and this is not allowed.

Likewise, calling someone stupid, a fool, retarded, dumb, is not allowed. If
you find yourself calling others by these, you probably want to change yourself
too. It is never beneficial to do this; it hurts both parties. This is very
difficult to do, but consider it training. Give them feedback and remain
neutral or better yet be loving.

As an exception to the general ad hominem rule, you can call someone an
asshole, jerk, dick, as these are common phrases; but only if you personally
feel hurt by it. Otherwise you can say "you are *being* a dick"; which is
different than "you *are* a dick". Third parties are not allowed direct
ad-hominem attacks. The counter party is allowed to express their pain via "you
are an asshole". Not bystanders. Even the counter party is encouraged to avoid
such language.

Going forward anyone engaging in abusive language will be banned for one week.
If they violate this again within a week of being unbanned they will be banned
for two weeks, and then they must refrain from being abusive for two weeks, and
then four, and so on. If they are not abusive during the entire
post-ban/grounding-period of 2^n weeks (n initially 0), the next time they get
banned it will be for a duration of 2^(n/2) weeks.

If you are banned, you have to ask someone else to help unban you only after
the "grounding" period.

I am not policing speech in general; I would not want to apply these rules to
the general public even if I was a hypothetical ruler. However this is a
controlled space and as far as I know these are the best rules that balance all
the factors. Feedback welcome to jkwon.work@gmail.com.
