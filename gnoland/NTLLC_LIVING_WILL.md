## Post NT,LLC Change of Control GovDAO US Election Process:

Like a living will. I will update this with my latest thougths.
It's not about what GovDAO or Gno.land should do, but what NT,LLC should do.
Nobody is obligated to follow this, but it clearly expresses my *will*.
Let happen what will happen.

My latest thinking about what should be done if I'm not able to find more US
GovDAO members, what NT,LLC should do. (e.g. NT,LLC Change of Control is
defined as the resignation, incapacitation, incarceration, or death of the
founder (Jae Kwon). In the case of resignation, incapacitation, or
incarceration upon return and in good mental health the US Preference Option
returns to NT,LLC at the founder's option.)

This is not complete but it has a lot of elements that I want.

 * US born (sole ideally like myself) citizen member, as the US is founded on
   protestantism the tree which carries the spirit though it seems waning in
   europe.

 * Heavy favor to the Libertarian party, the third party, closest in spirit to
   the founding of the USA; and many programmers are Libertarian. The only
   issue I have with Libertarianism is its lack of solution for the
   environmental problem; the other problems can be resolved by building more
   choices above, but few care enough about the host of our worldly
   civilization which is below. But focusing primarily on the environment also
   fails as it doesn't yet define what matters to humanity above. This
   condition would necessasrily have to be revisited once the Libertarian
   movement is no longer the third party. But in the lack of a clear
   alternative should the Libertarian party cease to be the third party (forth,
   or dissolved) in a two-party system then I would err on the side of the
   third party; and if the Libertarian party becomes first or second and the
   Republicans or Democrates become third, I would then pick from the third in
   this case as long as neither dominate the Libertarian party.

 * Other qualifications but broadly of the engineering discipline. Mathematics
   should be represented here too but not more than software engineers.
   Arguably we need software, electrical, quantum, and crypto+math,
   cogntive-studies+neuroscience+AI (altogether not separately), and in the
   future even chemical+material for laying our own fiber optic mesh net before
   the satellites have turned to a dust cloud. (global dimming?)

 * A Gno voting system that satisfies the Concorset Criterion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_the following is incomplete in wording, sometimes conflicting, still a draft
but with the spirit_

In the case of an NT,LLC Change of Control the option for NT,LLC to elect
concurrent GovDAO T1 or T2 members goes to the following process every year 3
months prior to the largest US Libertarian Convention hosted in the US.

 * A Gno.land US Election Committee for the year is chosen by NT,LLC, with at
   least 3 members one of who is the chairperson, and following that GovDAO may
   at any time elect up to the same number of committee members from GovDAO but
   with strict priority given to any T1, T2, or T3 US citizen GovDAO members.

 * Each committee member gets 1 vote with tie breaker going to the chairperson.

 * Thereafter NT,LLC may replace any committee members who resigns chosen by
   NT,LLC. Likewise GovDAO may by simple majority vote elect to replace any
   committee member who resigns chosen by GovDAO but with strict priority given
   to any T1, T2, or T3 US citizen GovDAO members.

 * The committee makes decisions by majority vote unless otherwise specified.

The Gno.land US Election Committee is funded by NT,LLC and GovDAO as much as
NT,LLC for the following:

 * Every year at the largest US Libertarian Convention hosted in the US, there
   will be a booth organized by the Gno.land US Election Commitee on behalf of
   itself or NT,LLC on which it is prominently displayed, "Gno.land US
   Represenative Engineer Election". At least half of the committee members
   must attend. If half of the committee members do not volunteer additional
   volunteers are chosen by the decision of the committee.

 * Two months until two weeks prior to the event the committee will also
   advertise this event in major social media forums for US Libertarians.

 * NT,LLC may donate funds to the Gno.land US Election Committee independently.

The qualification criteria for registrants and candidates are as follows:

 * Registrants must declare their candidacy if they wish to run. They may also
   not declare their candidacy and only vote among the candidates.

 * Registrants must be US citizens (and not of any other country) and present
   US resident over the age of 18. 

 * Candidates must be US born citizens or have been naturalized at least 12
   years prior.

 * Registrants must declare the US school, the science or engineering degree,
   and the year in which they received the degree (Bachelor's or higher). 

 * Registrants must declare their open source or open hardware contributions or
   a URL to their portfolio, and have made significant contributions to open
   source or open hardware projects.

 * In addition to the above criteria and also the current GovDAO General
   Criteria:

   * Registrants must declare that they are non-Catholic non-Mormon
     non-Jehova's Witness self-professed Christian. They may be
     non-denominational or have left these denominations.

   * Registrants must declare that they do not have and have not in the past
     been associated with any entity or organization that has confidential
     membership and requires members to protect each other, nor Freemasonry.

   * Registrants must declare that they are not and have not ever been
     associated with any US or foreigh government intelligence agency or
     program nor any law enforcement agency. Candidates may have served in the
     US military but they may not be presently serving. Candidates may not have
     served in any foreign military.

   * Registrants must not have been determined to have lied in the registration
     process.

 * All of the above qualification will be screened for by Gno.land US Election
   Committee.

 * Registrants must provide their email, full name, US state of current
   residence, and US phone number for SMS, Signal, or Whatsapp messages of
   their choice.

All of the above will be recorded in video for accountability's sake, and be
shared with all registrants for the year.

 * At least 12 qualified registrants must register in person and at least 3 of
   these must be qualified candidates. If these are not found as determined by
   the Gno.land US Election Committee within the next 7 days following the
   conclusion of the event:

   * GovDAO must fund the Gno.land US Election Committee members to personally
     attend any US based Libertarian, Gno.land, Atom.One, Gno-lang, Go-lang,
     Christian-developers, general OpenSource, or general OpenHardware;
     conventions, unconventions, or meetups open to the public; of their
     individual choice until 12 and 3 that qualify are found in person at these
     events. All qualification criteria still apply.

 * Registration is open for 2 more weeks after at least 12 and 3 qualified
   registrants and candidates are found, or 2 months and 7 days after the
   conclusion of the event; whichever is later. Present and past registrants
   are notified immediately.

   * Any present and past registrants are invited to register and/or to invite
     more registrants and candidates for this year.

   * During this time registration may happen remotely, but only by explicit
     invitation from a present registrant as proven to the committee.

     * Remote registrants must submit a video with their declarations and their
       inviter and also agree to share all information with all present
       registrants.

     * Remote registrants must provide proof of US residency and citizenship.

     * A registrant who invites two or more registrants who falsify their
       registration information are themselves considered to have falsified
       their registration. All registrants invited by those who falsified their
       registration and all of their invitees recursively are disqualified for
       this and future registrations unless an exception is decided on a case
       by case basis by the committee by majority decision.

 * After the 12 and 3 qualified are registered and after the final 2 weeks
   registration period, another week is allotted for the Gno.land US Election
   Committee to complete verification that each registrant or candidate are
   qualified. All Disqualifications and the reason(s) are published for all
   registrants, NT,LLC, and GovDAO to see.

 * After the week of verification, all of the registrants are invited via their
   submitted contact methods to vote using a voting scheme that satisfies
   concorset criterion. NT,LLC chooses what scheme and implementation to use,
   and GovDAO must fund for at least half of its development.

 * For simplicity and security voting is done openly with everyone's votes
   published for everyone else to see who votes, and the vote is published in
   real time or at least once a day between 5pm and 7pm PDT. Registrants may
   change their vote at any time.

 * Voting commences for one week. Registrants may only vote for candidates.

 * If there were 36 or more registrants and 9 or more candidates, the top 3
   candidates are chosen. Else if there were 24 or more registrants and 6 or
   more candidates, the top 2 candidates are chosen. Else the top 1 candidate
   is chosen.

 * Of the chosen candidates the Gno.land Election Committee selects at least
   one chosen candidate to add to T1 or T2 for any spots so as to satisfy the
   US Preference Option. Not all chosen candidates need be granted membership.

   * If the Gno.land Election Committee cannot decide by two weeks after the
     election is complete, NT,LLC decides.

 * The Gno.land Election Committee for the year is disbanded and all
   documentation provided to NT,LLC and GovDAO.

All GovDAO elected members through this process must show engagement with
Gno.land and the GovDAO process and make contributions to the project.

 * If any of these newly GovDAO members do not show engagement after six months
   of membership NT,LLC may elect to eject or demote one of these members.

 * If there were two or more elected members GovDAO by Supermajority Decision
   may also elect to eject or demote one of these members after six months with
   these members abstaining from voting or meeting for this purpose.

 * If there were three or more elected members NT,LLC and GovDAO by
   Supermajority Decision may jointly elect to eject or demote one of these
   members at any time with these members abstaining from voting or meeting for
   this purpose.

 * After two years the remaining elected members' membership in GovDAO is
   considered equal to other members of the tier and cannot be ejected or
   demoted by these terms.

 * Ejected members are no longer eligible for future registration or
   membership.
