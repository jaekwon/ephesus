# The Origins of Cosmos Drama
https://forum.cosmos.network/t/the-origin-of-cosmos-drama/11927 Oct 2023

Originally a reply in another thread but worth creating a separate thread for.
This is not merely historical, it is the root of the problem plaguing Cosmos
today.  This is not only a political and technical problem, this is a spiritual
and moral problem.

2013 I start AIB, initially created FtNox an exchange. I maybe wrote the first
exchange that also could prove its reserves. I never launched because just
about when I was going to, I discovered the 1988 BFT paper.

2015/2016 there is CryptoEconomicon in the south bay in california. I meet
Chris Harborne and Ethan.

2016 I work with Ethan as a loan employee since I wanted to build the EVM on
top of Tendermint, and Eris wanted a permissioned EVM. I teach everything I
know about Tendermint to Ethan, and he asks his professor if he can write his
thesis on it.

Around this time Ethan was still employed with Eris Industries. Eris Industries
it was said that there were five cofounders, but the two public facing
cofounders are Casey and Preston Byrne.

The LICENSE at this time was not well defined. I said that it will be published
“at least as copyleft” but it’s pretty fucking clear that I am also interested
in more liberal licenses, since I mentioned that I’m a Kopimist by heart. Look
at the repo.

I spend 3 months to no avail to convince Preston and Casey to allow me to
publish Tendermint as Apache2. Preston for being a lawyer is a complete clown
and keeps pretending that dual licensing isn’t a thing.

I spend time developing ABCI just so that I can give up the EVM and the
permissioning that I wrote, just so that I can retain the right to publish
Tendermint as Apache2.

During this time I learn that Chris Harborne self admittedly saved George Soros
in Thailand during the IMF incident, that he is ex-mi6, laundered money for
Obama using jet fuel. I later learn that he is also the lead funder for Brexit.
He is also clearly a major funder of Ethereum. He also apparently had a major
role in Tether, the project that was founded by the infamous Brock Pierce. I’m
not even going to talk about the string of deaths of my friends around that
fellow.

Ethan helps out with the testing suite for Tendermint and fixing bugs (he
didn’t design Tendermint, but to his credit he did help with the test suite),
while I’m working to develop an investment strategy trying to raise from
Bitcoin savvy VCs. None of them understand what proof of stake is.

As a last resort I came up with the Cosmos whitepaper based on my own ideas
about inserting light client proofs in the blockchain itself. Tendermint was
always designed for efficient light client proofs, when most of the blockchain
world gave up on it.

2016 I write just about all of the Cosmos whitepaper save for the non-technical
and Tendermint related parts of the whitepaper which I delegate to Ethan. I am
the only one interfacing with up to five law firms eventually settling on MME
to create a foundation, modeling off of Ethereum. I create the PLAN.md, the
fundraiser docs, pretty much everything about Cosmos and the ICF and the plan,
technical and nontechnical, were my creations.

MME says I need to have at least 3 people in the FC. They say they can provide
a third neutral swiss board member. I say fine, I can invite Ethan in as the
third. Mind you I was already being super generous with his equity in AIB for
being a late cofounder. I started the company years before Ethan joined but I
gave him half of what I had.

I travel the world pitching Cosmos, to the point that I vowed not to fly
internationally again. Ethan never did.

Late 2017/2018 or so I take a break for a few months, I’ve been at this for
four years. By the time I come back to full time I see that Ethan had hired a
ton of managers. Ok, I can work with that.

Around 2018 shit gets really weird.

 * Ethan starts harping about me leaving the ICF, ever since I brought it up
   once.  He says I need to leave because of conflict of interest. More on the
   hypocrisy later.

 * Executive retreat with Ethan, Zaki, and others five of us total. Zaki makes
   clear he doesn’t care about the mission but cares about making money for
   himself.

 * At a crypto conference, OpenLibra is proposed by essentially a scammer who
   puts up my photo and Sunny’s as if we are core members of his project when
   it’s hardly the case. Ethan and Zaki know this and I warn them not to
   associate with the scammer but they don’t care.

 * While checking up on OpenLibra I comment about the voting system they are
   proposing and I point out how it can easily be gamed, and they don’t care.

 * I see Zaki starting to call himself cofounder of Cosmos despite only having
   joined after much of the genesis software was already complete, and he
   wasn’t even part of the coding team. I ask him to stop, but it keeps
   happening. Here were the engineers behind the hub software: Sunny, Dev,
   Chris Goes, Ethan Frey, Alessio, Rigel, and myself. Neither Ethan nor Zaki
   were involved.

 * Jessy Irwin comes up to me and brags about how she invited her ex into her
   apartment on false pretenses to get revenge on him, and how she hacked into
   his computer and stole his bitcoins, and showed me the purse she bought with
   those Bitcoins.

 * I tell this to Zaki and he insists that we need Jessy to complete the job.
   Her job was basically interfacing with HackerOne. I make an exception for
   Zaki, but refuse to give Jessy full superadmin privileges for Tendermint’s
   google apps, since with that you can do a lot more than her job entails.

 * Zaki starts spreading FUD that I am imposing a glass ceiling, being sexually
   discriminatory to the whole company, despite knowing of the above. This is
   after he told me that his favorite book is the “traitorous eight”, and
   comments like “I’m like a god”, “that plan isn’t evil enough”. Clearly using
   dark magic for self gain.

 * I propose the Virgo idea and Zaki approves, likes it so much he wants to
   present it himself to the company. This was after we agreed on a separation
   of roles; I will focus on new projects like Virgo, and he will help manage
   Cosmos.  The separation of concerns was super clear.

 * I let Ethan and Zaki take over the routine AIB/ICF negotiations since it’s
   routine work. By this time the ICF had over $100,000,000 worth of ATOMs and
   cash and crypto in treasury. AIB is right up there but has less. It should
   be clear to everyone that there is absolutely no problem. Next thing I hear
   the engineers lamenting that their job security is at stake. This makes no
   fucking sense, the ICF should obviously be supporting us and Ethan and Zaki
   were responsible. This ends up being blamed on me.

 * The engineers of the company leave and the primary claim is lack of
   certainty of funding, and in an open letter they wrote some other non
   concrete things.  Funny that it happens right after I start demanding that
   everyone report transparently on their conflicts of interests.

 * I say once in our internal Slack in #general that we should strive to write
   excellent software that will be deemed worthy in the future, that we are
   doing the work of God. Once did I mention God there. Later Zaki resigns and
   claims that I harassed everyone in EVERY slack channel with religious
   harassment.  Lies. Jessy Irwin claims ambiguously that I harassed her, in
   the height of the #metoo movement. I have zero record of sexual harassment
   even to this day.  ZERO.

 * For the kind of cultural problems, let me tell you of one A in Berlin who
   got so offended that I suggested in a private call that we need to hire more
   concurrency experts; he wasn’t an expert in concurrency and he simply could
   not stand the fact that I was implying that he wasn’t already an expert.

 * Ethan and Jack were involved in a FUCKING SKUNKWORKS PROJECT IN AIB named
   “DOUBLEDARE” whereby they decided to talk amongst themselves about removing
   a key component of the entire project, AMINO, INSTEAD OF FUCKING FIXING IT
   BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO. This was WHILE I spent months BRAINDAMANGING
   AMINO to be protobuf complete because they insisted on supporting protobuf.
   Even after I fixed it up 99% of the way they insisted on removing it. If you
   want to see what I mean, check out the difference between AMINO then and the
   new AMINO in gnolang’s TM2 directory. Complete insanity, not to mention
   deceitful AND ILLEGAL.

 * Later I learn that Zaki is being sued for basically trying the same shit he
   did to me to someone else. The person suing him I trust, and he says Zaki
   threatened him saying “Do you see what I did to Jae?”. I’m not even talking
   about Shaun.

 * Later I find out that Ethan had set up Informal with an outsized financial
   incentive for himself. This is completely ludicrous and insanely unethical
   because the entire ICF was founded for the purpose of public funding.
   Instead of giving 20% of AIB I GAVE HALF FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMMONS FUNDING.
   This is reflected in the fundraiser plan and docs. It is illegal for FC
   members to enrich themselves this way but apparently Swiss law is full of
   holes just like their cheese. I suppose now that either MME is just super
   corrupt (they are getting sued by other projects) or their raison d’etre is
   to profit from their supposed neutrality.

 * Later I find out that Jacob introduced Grace to Preston’s law firm. I was
   told that Preston sold the idea that he would help resolve the lawsuit
   faster because he knows me. Preston disappears from the picture and
   meanwhile their lawfirm makes ridiculous assertions such as, they won’t
   mediate until the lawsuit is dropped. This is ridiculous. Community is
   outraged.

 * Later I find out that Brian Crain WAS ALSO AN EMPLOYEE OF ERIS INDUSTRIES.
   Had I known, I would have never accepted his entry into the FC. I would
   never give up control of the ICF to Eris, they were the ones who tried to
   fuck me over in 2016. Ludicrous.

 * When I left the FC I said in no uncertain terms, in the strongest terms
   possible, that the person they wanted to replace me with SHOULD NOT be in
   the FC because they were an employee of AIB, and I have worked with them,
   and they DID NOT demonstrate the needed expertise. I suggested Sunny. They
   all completely dismiss my remarks and decide that it will be this person.

 * This I haven’t verified but I later learn that this person’s father was a
   close friend a ghostwriter for Bill Fucking Gates.

 * Brian Crain AFAIK is married to the daughter of an ex dictator of Turkey.

 * Ethan Buchman was somehow magically best friends with Vlad Zamfir. He is
   part of the Creative Destruction Lab in Canada. I could say a lot more along
   these lines but I’ll stop here.

I haven’t even mentioned the stupidity of prop 69 (vm on hub), 82 (atom2), and
now they want to remove the 2/3 bonding target for an IBC hub. These are just a
FEW of the points I can recall of the top of my head after getting PTSD from
the amount of CHICANERY and DECEIT.

Check Chjango’s recent expose with Jack Zampolin as an example of the culture I
am fighting against.

Basically it’s hard not to see from my shoes that the project or at least the
ICF was subverted by deep state forces.

 * Why is Preston so often cited on ZeroHedge articles like he’s some paragon
   of truth?
 * Who were the original “five cofounders” of Eris and what are their
   backgrounds?
 * Why was their mascot the Marmot? Because they always planned on burrowing?
   :wink:
 * Why did they rename from Eris to Monax? Maybe the connection to
   “destruction” is too obvious?
 * Why do I keep seeing a connection to elitist backgrounds in all of this?
 * A man wants to know.

I wouldn’t even care if they were doing their jobs.  It seems that they care
more about Ethereum and Urbit.  They should all disclose their entire positions
and all of their conflicts of interests.  But really they should just all
resign.

The reason the trauma won’t just heal and go away is because it’s wrong to stay
silent.  Gore2020 didn’t kill me, ATOM2 with Pepe the frog crucified didn’t do
it.  They should take the L and fuck off and admit defeat before it’s too late.

Ultimately this is my mistake.  After George Soros fucked over Asia and even
caused my Daewoo to collapse where my dad held an executive position, I thought
listening to Chris Harborne would be a good idea just because he was well
connected.

 * I should have not listened to him.
 * I should not have created a Swiss foundation, or trust MME, or a “neutral
   board member”.
 * I should have fired Jessy on the spot.
 * I should have fired Zaki.
 * I should have said goodbye to Ethan.
 * I should have fired Jack.
 * I should have should have should have but at every turn there appeared to be
   reasons why it would be a bad idea… maybe if I give enough feedback or
   communicate with Ethan enough maybe Ethan would see.  WRONG.

There are four types of people in this world.

 1. There are the entitled who grew up with silver spoons in a pot of evil. 
 2. There are those who sell themselves to the above for Mammon.
 3. There are those who grew up in poverty but got lucky, or was privileged and
    had the right upbringing, and feel a responsibility to reduce human
    suffering.
 4. There is everyone else who never received or never gave themselves the
    chance.

Pick wisely, because the hour of judgement is upon us.

Do not compromise on your values and do not give people third and fourth
chances.  Do not feel intimidated by numbers and
gangstalking/social_engineering tactics.  There are some lines (like doubledare
or stealing) that are immediate grounds for exile.

To this day I have yet to hear a single apology.  To be fair Zaki once did
internally to AIB, but not for what I wrote above.

After I resigned from AIB by popular demand (though nobody sane would have
agreed if they were in my shoes), and finally from ICF because it was already
clear that the ICF was completely subverted (though I still regret the
decision), I have since been working on the best smart contracting system the
world has yet even seen.

It’s still crazy to me that after Ethan and I decided that in order for us to
make progress we needed to create our own isolated budgets, so I finally agreed
on the creation of Informal, while the Virgo budget was equally carved out for
my direction; and just because I chose to keep the funds in the ICF (obviously
for accountability) since I have resigned from the FC they decided to
completely ignore this and pretend like that arrangement never happened.
Meanwhile I have learned since that the “coop” Ethan created with Informal is
not a coop at all and Ethan has an outsized financial stake in it; so HE is the
one who has a conflict of interest, and he created it AFTER he pressured me to
leave the ICF on the same grounds, that I have the conflict; after I created
all of these things.

The magnitude of the hypocrisy and chicanery and deceit is what turned me
Christian. Here is it what did it for me. The first letter in the last book of
the bible spoke to me like nobody else could at a time I most needed to hear
it.

Message to the Church in Ephesus (Acts 19:8-12)

1Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that
holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the
seven golden candlesticks; 2I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience,
and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which
say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 3And hast borne,
and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
4Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first
love. 5Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the
first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy
candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. 6But this thou hast, that
thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 7He that hath an
ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that
overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
paradise of God.

Jesus is King of Kings.

If you all just want to support the status quo despite these revelations, well
fuck me, maybe it is simply too late.  Don’t be surprised if everyone decent
starts to exodus to a new hub.  I cannot in good conscience support what has
been and now is worse.  The fucking buck stops here.  Trust me, it is better to
sell and leave now if you don’t agree with me.  Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Doing any kind of psychoanalysis of Cosmos without understanding the chicaneers
and their works, and what REALLY led to what they called gore2020, is complete
folly, and only serves to sustain the status quo.

Admitting the failures of the ICF and failing to act against the ICF, or
suggesting that we simply ignore it, when the hub SHOULD be taking action, is
again being an apologist to evil.

I have given them AMPLE WARNING. Despite knowing that the above is true they
have continued to play their playbook of mass brainwashing Cosmonauts and
continuing their attacks against the integrity of the hub, and turning the ICF
into their slush fund, and then daring to ask for more with ATOM2.

JUDGEMENT DAY IS HERE.

Here is the plan.

Create an opposition political party that represents the original values of
Cosmos.  Make a new blockchain that counters the effects of the
ICF/Informal/Stride political party.  Play fire for fire to gather support
around this new “liquid staking” hub.  Oppose the status quo until they leave
due to the governance stalemate on the main hub.  Failing that, if they do not
leave, develop our political party hub as the new Cosmos hub.  Checkmate.
