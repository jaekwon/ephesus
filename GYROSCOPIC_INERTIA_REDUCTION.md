Professor Eric Laithwaite shows what happens when a very heavy wheel (20 kg) is spun up to 2,500 rpm.

Look at the old man in the video.
Think of the spinning wheel as a rocket body.
Think the old man's hand representing propellant lift.

[b]He CANNOT lift it with ONE hand WITHOUT rotation.
He CAN lift it with ONE hand WITH rotation.
[/b]
or more precisely,

[b]He CAN lift it with TWO hands WITH STRUGGLING, WITHOUT rotation.
He CANNOT lift it with ONE hand WITHOUT STRUGGLING, WITHOUT rotation.
He CAN lift it with ONE hand WITHOUT STRUGGLING at all, WITH rotation!
[/b]

Work put in to lift is W = F × d
The force is clearly *less* than when lifting normally.

W_with_spin = F_with_spin × d
W_no_spin = F_no_spin × d
F_with_spin < F_no_spin,
W_with_spin < W_no_spin.

In the end you lose rotational energy by lifting it this way, and clearly rotational energy was translated into work/lift energy; or, more likely is that lift inertia was reduced!

Now imagine your entire rocket is rotating like the wheel (e.g. fuel), and the end of the rod is where the burners are (shooting opposite of where you want to go).

[b]A spinning rocket/wheel can be lifted with LESS PROPELLANT.[/b]

Again,

[b]He can NOT lift it with one hand without rotation.
He CAN lift it with one hand with rotation.[/b]

--> A SPINNING ROCKET/WHEEL CAN BE LIFTED WITH LESS PROPELLANT!

Either the gyroscopic effect is translating rotation energy into lateral movement work, or, [b]it is reducing the lateral/upward movement inertia.[/b]

In the following video Veritasium shows that the weight does not change whether or not a gyroscope rotates.

And concludes that even though it feels lighter, it is not lighter.

What he missed is that you need to apply additional *upwards* force/jerk beyond the g-force to get the desired lift effect.

[u]Professor Eric Laithwaite gave it "higher precession" AND jerked it upward and continued pushing.[/u]

[u]Veritasium only gave the gyroscope "higher precession" on the scale.[/u] There was no additional force beyond the g-scale, there was no extra lift. There was no jerking upwards, no overall upwards movement.

In one, the hand lifts upwards AND the spinning weight. On the scale, the axle does not lift upwards, only the spinning weight.

[b]What Professor Eric Laithwaite did and what Veritasium showed on the scale are different.[/b]

[b]LOOK HOW HARD IT IS WITH ONE HAND WITHOUT SPINNING!
THAT IS NOT JUST AN ILLUSION OR FEELING.
IT IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT IN BEHAVIOR![/b]

Now imagine you have this in space with no gravity.

As for how to get a rocket/wheel to rotate in space in the first place... start with two rocket/wheels and counter-rotate them, now you have two rocket/wheels to work with.

Why not lift without any propellant?

If you use the upward momentum of the spinning weight and then let the rod rotate with how the spinning weight wants to rotate without exerting any other force on the rod, you have effectively translated rotational inertia into upwards movement inertia of the whole system without any exhaust.

If you have a sophisticated arbitrary rotational system to hold it all together, you can get lift from a completely enclosed system; e.g. a battery.

So this must be how the tic tac works.

You just need a wheel, a rod, contained in an inner sphere, which rotates arbitrarily within an outer sphere, and magnetic omnidirectional forces applied to the inner sphere.

You need the rod to be anchored to the inner sphere at one end at a time, or both ends at once depending on the situation.
