According to the Hebrew calendar accounting for "the lost years", it is around the year 5950 (since Adam).  And when you look at the year for Exodus, 2448 (since Adam), you arrive at 2024 - (5950 - 2448) - 1, which is 1479BC.

The pharaoh who ruled until death in 1479BC is Thutmose II. The last war campaign by Thutmose II in Sinai was against the Shasu people, nomads who also lived in Canaan. The Shasu were also associated with "yhw", which is pretty much the YHWH tetragrammaton. 

Related are Hyksos who were expelled a few centuries earlier after ruling Egypt, and "Hyksos" literally means "king-shepherds". Both the Shasu and Hyksos spoke Semitic languages.

Thutmose II's mummy is the only one that has cysts; evidence of some plague.

The coincidences are too damn high. 

From this we can also derive that "the lost years" of the Hebrew calendar are real; that the Hebrew year is close to 5950, and that the mysticism being pushed by masonic sources about Thoth, are not surprising, as it was Thutmose's son who the Hebrew Israelites escaped from.
