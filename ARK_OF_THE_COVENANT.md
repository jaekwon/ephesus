# The Ark of the Covenant, and how it pertains to Freemasonry, Israel, and Dolmen.

NOTE: As I have no time to polish this writing, for now the facts will be
presented without much overview except the following: once you see all the
facts, you will observe a pattern, and if you have eyes to see, the pattern
will speak for themselves.

## Freemasonry and Boaz and Jachin

It is will understood that the two pillars represent Boaz and Jachin. Sometimes
you only see the letters B, and J associated with these columns, because it is
meant to be hidden.

Trump just yesterday published a cryptic message about 2 poles, because he is
also a Freemason, as were many past US presidents, even George Washington.

## Boaz and Jachin and the Old Testament, and Cherubim

Boaz and Jachin are mentioned first in 1 Kings, and then in 2 Chronicles, and
in both are referenced with Cherubim, but only 2 Chronicles details the
dimensions of the Cherubim, especially the width of their wings which are large
enough to cover half the width of the temple.

## Cherubim and the Ark of the Testament

In other places the shape of the Ark of the Testament is described, namely
Exodus 37; notice that the wings are supposed to cover the ark completely,
unlike all modern depictions of the Ark of the Covenant.

1-Kings-8 explains that the two Cherubim of Solomon's Temple also have wings
that overcover and protect the Ark when it enters the temple.
